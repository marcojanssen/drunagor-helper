  - id: x-hp
    keyword: "+X HP"
    description: The Hero's Maximum Health increases by +X points. As explained on page
      7 of the Age of Darkness Rulebook, a Hero's Maximum Health, however, can never
      exceed 16. If a Hero has two or more effects that increase their Health Points,
      you should always add them up, but never exceed the value of 16 shown on the Hero
      board. All Maximum Health that exceeds 16 is considered wasted.
  - id: x-hp-(simple)
    keyword: "+X HP (SIMPLE)"
    description: If you prefer not to deal with the granularity of the +X HP rule, you
      can choose the simple version and disregard the second and third NOTEs. So, if
      you lose an effect that confers +X HP, you lose Health accordingly. However, if
      you regain these effects later, you won't recover any Health, even if the sum
      of the +X HP effects you have exceeds 16 Health.

      roll. Only affects Accuracy, not getting a Critical Hit.
  - id: x-to-hit
    keyword: "+X TO HIT"
    description: "Any Weapon Attacks you make gain a +X bonus on the Accuracy Check
      to hit your targets. Keep in mind that this bonus affects only the outcome of
      a Weapon's Accuracy, not whether you get a Critical Hit: If you have +6 TO HIT
      and roll a 14 on the D20, it doesn't mean that it is a “natural 20”—it is an
      Accuracy 20 and a natural 14."
  - id: x-movement
    keyword: "+X MOVEMENT"
    description: You received X additional movement points for every Move effect gained.
  - id: action-cubes-(ac)
    keyword: ACTION CUBES (AC)
    description: Colored cubes spend by Heroes to use their skills.
  - id: activate
    keyword: ACTIVATE
    description: "Activate is a complicated term that appears in many effects over the
      three generations of the AoD System. At its design root, Activate is the instruction
      to take a turn. So, when you Activate a Monster, for example, you take a turn
      with that Monster; Whenever a Monster takes a turn, we say it is being “activated.”
      When a Character is activated, it takes a turn as normal: its Conditions trigger
      at the beginning of the turn, then its Triggered Abilities fire, and finally it
      takes a Movement Action and/or an Attack Action. Pets, however, have an optional
      effect: when you Activate one of them, instead of making them take a turn, you
      can Summon them. It's worth remembering: a Summoned Pet appears in an adjacent
      unoccupied space next to its Master."
  - id: adj-or-adjacent
    keyword: ADJ OR ADJACENT
    description: This effect can only affect a Target in an adjacent square to the casting
      Character, regardless of the Skill's Range.
  - id: area
    keyword: AREA
    description: Refers to a blue square on a map tile.
  - id: all
    keyword: ALL
    description: An effect with this term means equivalent to the damage the Target
      is receiving. The effect still only applies to one Target of an attack, not both
      or more, during MULTISHOT, CLEAVE or STRIKE.
  - id: ambush
    keyword: AMBUSH
    description: Monster teleports to any unoccupied space adjacent to its target of
      that target's choice. Suffers from terrain landed on.
  - id: attack-twice
    keyword: ATTACK TWICE
    description: Monster moves once then attacks two times. Each attack is resolved
      separately (includes reactions). If character is out of range between attacks,
      the monster may choose another target for second attack as long it doesn't have
      to move.
  - id: aura
    keyword: AURA
    description: A hero can only have one and is removed when the hero is KNOCKED OUT
      and receives a TRAUMA CUBE. (Not removed during Camp Phase)
  - id: aura-(token)
    keyword: AURA (TOKEN)
    description: As a Resolution effect, a Hero is often instructed to write down an
      Aura on their Campaign Log or Companion App. You can keep this token on your board
      as a tactile and visual reminder that you have a special effect noted there. Aura
      tokens are Reminder tokens and were introduced in Apocalypse.
  - id: available
    keyword: AVAILABLE
    description: Available refers more to a game term than necessarily a Keyword. An
      Available Skill, for example, is a Skill learned by a Hero that does not have
      its slot currently occupied (either by an Action Cube, Curse Cube, or Trauma Cube).
      An Available Resolution, in turn, is a Resolution that has not yet been chosen
      in a Charged Interaction or has not been declared “unavailable” by some effect.
  - id: avoid
    keyword: AVOID
    description: Avoid is not properly a Keyword, however, it is a new term in relation
      to the Corebox, so it is worth clarifying. “Avoid” is used to indicate that you
      do not suffer some effect, much as PREVENT would, but since PREVENT is a Keyword,
      the adoption of a different term is necessary.
  - id: bash
    keyword: BASH
    description: Bash is a trait characteristic of the Hero Andreas. Whenever a Skill
      has Bash, at the moment you are about to resolve the effect containing the Bash
      Keyword, you may discard 2 Shield tokens. If you do, add the effect described
      between the “[]” to your Skill resolution. Otherwise, you must resolve that Skill
      without considering it a part of the effect.
  - id: bear-trap
    keyword: BEAR TRAP
    description: All enemies in AREA take 2 non-preventable Damage, BLEED 2, DISCARD.
  - id: beginning-of-turn-(bot)
    keyword: BEGINNING OF TURN (BOT)
    description: BOT is an abbreviation used to describe the “Beginning of Turn” moment
      of time, when some Characters’ special abilities are triggered, right after they
      suffer the effects of the Conditions they possess that also trigger at the beginning
      of their turn.
  - id: bleed-x
    keyword: BLEED X
    description: The Target takes X BLEED tokens. At the beginning of that character's
      next turn, it takes 1 non-preventable damage for each BLEED token it has and then
      removes all of them from its board. BLEED is a stackable Condition.
  - id: blindness
    keyword: BLINDNESS
    description: This is a special ability that a few Monsters possess and that turns
      them into very dangerous enemies. When a Character suffers BLINDNESS, they must
      take a BLIND token and keep it on their board. While holding a BLIND Token, the
      Character automatically misses any weapon attack if their natural d20 roll is
      10 or lower, even if they have succeeded on their Weapon's Accuracy check. BLINDNESS
      is a Redundant Condition that lasts until the Character takes a Recall Action
      or it is removed by a CLEANSE effect.
  - id: bloodseeker
    keyword: BLOODSEEKER
    description: A Monster with Bloodseeker Targets the Weakest Hero (The one with the
      lowest Health at the moment) as its Primary Target.
  - id: bounty
    keyword: BOUNTY
    description: Bounty replaces and updates the “LOOT” Keyword that Companions had
      in Age of Darkness. Therefore, when a Monster is defeated by an attack that has
      BOUNTY, that Monster drops a LOOT token when removed from the board (LOOT tokens
      are Ground Movable Objects that can be collected with a Minor Action; when collecting
      Loot, a Hero draws a Chest card, but does not roll the Trap Die).
  - id: brittle
    keyword: BRITTLE
    description: Some attacks are capable of leaving their opponents vulnerable. When
      a Character suffers Brittle, they must take a Brittle token and keep it on their
      board. If they are a Hero, Pet, or Companion of any sort, the next time they suffer
      damage from any source, they will suffer double that damage and remove their Brittle
      token (remember, suffered damage is the damage taken that was not prevented).
      If they are a Monster, the next weapon or magic attack that hits them turns into
      a Critical Hit and removes their Brittle token. Brittle lingers until it is removed
      or is triggered as described. It is a Redundant Condition.
  - id: burn-x
    keyword: BURN X
    description: The Target takes X BURN tokens. At the beginning of that character's
      next turn, it takes 1 non-preventable damage for each BURN token it has and then
      removes one of those tokens from its board. BURN is a stackable Condition.
  - id: cancel
    keyword: CANCEL
    description: Cancel is a term that has come to be associated with Interruptions
      due to their ability to respond to an attack while it is being delivered, rather
      than after it has already hit its target. When an attack is Canceled, this means
      that it no longer exists and doesn’t cause damage to any of its targets anymore.
      Characters who have already used Interrupts for a Canceled attack are still considered
      to have used those abilities, but after the attack is Canceled, no other Characters
      can use an Interrupt (and of course, no Reactions) against that attack.
  - id: cast
    keyword: CAST
    description: This term is used to define the moment when an effect is applied in
      the game, often related to the Character responsible for causing it. So, when
      your Hero spends one of their Action Cubes to use a Battle Focus Skill, for example,
      that Hero is casting a FOCUS 1 AND CLEANSE 1 effect.
  - id: catalyze
    keyword: CATALYZE
    description: This is a Keyword designed to condense an effect into a single word,
      saving text space. When a Hero Catalyzes, it means that the next Action Cube they
      use this turn (current turn only) is treated as a Wild Cube (if it is used to
      use a Hero Skill, treat all numbers written in their numerical form as if they
      were doubled). Wild Cubes can be used as if they were any color, but it is important
      to remember that the Range for the effects of a Skill activated using a Wild Cube
      is based on its Type (i.e., a Melee Skill activated through a Wild Cube still
      has Melee Range).
  - id: chain-up
    keyword: CHAIN-UP
    description: Monsters with this skill specialize in capturing Heroes. At the beginning
      of their turn, immediately after suffering the effects of any Condition that might
      be affecting them, a Monster with Chain-Up targets the Strongest Hero who is not
      adjacent and within Range 1 (if there is such a Hero). That Hero suffers 2 non-preventable
      damage and is dragged to an empty square of their choice that is adjacent to the
      Monster with Chain-Up. If there is no space for them, the Hero suffers 4 non-preventable
      damage instead of 2, but they are not dragged.
  - id: channel
    keyword: CHANNEL
    description: As long as a Skill with Channel has an Action Cube occupying its slot
      (not when it is blocked by a Curse Cube or Trauma Cube), the passive bonus described
      in “Channel - Effect” takes effect as if it were a Passive Skill. This benefit
      is also applied to the very Skill that generated it. It lasts until this Action
      Cube is recalled.
  - id: character
    keyword: CHARACTER
    description: Heroes, Monsters, Pets, NPCs, Companions and so on. All can receive
      effects like PREVENT, but only characters with cards or boards can hold Conditions
      or Resources. Characters are Movable Solid Objects for rules purposes.
  - id: charge
    keyword: CHARGE
    description: "Some Monsters have the ability to charge their enemies to maximize
      their attacks. Whenever a Monster with this ability moves 3 or more squares in
      order to reach their target, consider the base damage value of this attack as
      if it were double. Remember: Monsters will always move the least amount of squares
      they can in order to reach their targets or seek a position on top of Darkness.
      Despite this ability, Monsters are not smart enough to take the longest way to
      reach their target and receive this bonus. Their behavior remains the same: they
      move as few squares as possible to the target unless they can finish the movement
      upon Darkness or can avoid harmful terrain while doing so. Darkness damage boost,
      as well as damage reducers like Intimidate, are counted after this base value
      has been determined."
  - id: charm
    keyword: CHARM
    description: "By enchanting the simple-mindedness of a Creature of Darkness, a Hero
      can force it to attack its own allies. When a Monster is Charmed, the player who
      bewitched it immediately activates that Monster and controls its turn. In this
      way, you can force it to attack its own allies, move through harmful terrain,
      or position them in a disadvantageous or inefficient way. However, while fighting
      to keep control of its own mind, a Monster is weaker: its attack deals only half
      (round up) of the damage it would normally (collateral damage is applied as normal).
      Darkness damage boost, as well as damage reducers like Intimidate, are counted
      after this base value has been determined."
  - id: claim
    keyword: CLAIM
    description: Claim is a typical Warlord effect, representing their ability to coordinate
      the assaults of their allies. When a Hero uses Claim, they place (or replace)
      the Banner on an empty square that is adjacent to them. While under the influence
      of a Banner, as a Minor Action, a Hero may discard an INSPIRATION token to make
      a Weapon Attack of +0 HIT. For rules purposes, all squares that are adjacent to
      a Banner are considered “Under the Banner”. Finally, Banners are Movable Solid
      Objects considered Furniture and, therefore, can be crushed by Large Monsters
      and cause 2 DMG AND BLEED 2 if they are thrown at a Character.
  - id: cleanse-x
    keyword: CLEANSE X
    description: "Target removes up to X CC and all POISON from its board. <br><br>
      *Apocalypse updated CLEANSE as follows:* <br><br> The target removes up to X Curse
      Cubes or Condition Stacks from its board. A Stack is: all tokens of the same kind
      the Character has. For each CLEANSE point received, that Character may choose
      to remove a Curse Cube or a Condition Stack. They don’t have to spend all the

    keyword: COMMAND
    description: Activates the next Strongest Monster (not itself), then continues its
      turn.
  - id: command-a-draugr
    keyword: COMMAND A DRAUGR
    description: To Command a Draugr means to activate a Draugr of your choice that
      is already on the board. Unlike other Pets, Draugrs cannot be “Raised” through
      a “Command” effect or vice-versa. For them, these effects act independently. Other
      than this detail, Draugrs follow the same rules as a Pet when it comes to their
      turns and for other rules purposes.
  - id: command-a-pet
    keyword: COMMAND A PET
    description: Command a Pet is an effect similar to Activate a Pet, with the restriction
      that it can never be used to invoke a Pet on the board. So, when you Command a
      Pet you have summoned, you must choose a Pet that is already on the board and
      that is affiliated with you to Activate. An activation through this effect consists
      of a Move Action followed by a normal Attack Action. Similarly, any Conditions
      that this Pet has at the time it is activated are triggered. If another effect
      that allows you to summon a Pet on the board is triggered at the same time you
      would Command a Pet, you can choose to resolve it first
  - id: companions
    keyword: COMPANIONS
    description: Activates after the hero they follow, Move then Attack. Will only be
      attacked if no hero is in range. Top left number is STURDINESS. Can hold SHIELDS
      and receive PREVENT effects. Discharged during Camp Phase.

      **Dungeon Roll Skills, Equipment Skills and Reactions, unless stated otherwise,
      cannot be copied.**
  - id: counter-x
    keyword: COUNTER X
    description: Some Monsters are versed in the art of fencing and know how to take
      advantage of a Hero's slip-ups when fighting them. Whenever a Hero misses a Weapon
      Attack against a Monster that has this ability (an attack is only considered a
      miss after using their reroll abilities), the Monster swings their weapon around,
      causing the described amount of non-preventable damage to all enemies of the Monster
      that are adjacent to it.
  - id: cover
    keyword: COVER
    description: Some protective abilities that Heroes possess go beyond just mitigating
      damage; they can also change the target of an attack. When a Character Covers
      the target of an attack, they redirect that attack to themselves, becoming the
      new target of that attack. Any Prevent effect that comes with a Cover effect is
      also redirected to the new target of that attack. If an attack is targeting you
      and another target at the same time, you can still Cover that other Character,
      but you will suffer both attacks as if you had been targeted by it twice.
  - id: covetous
    keyword: COVETOUS
    description: A Monster with Covetous Targets the Hero that is holding more Resource
      tokens (FOCUS, SHIELD, and KI are examples) as its Primary Target. If two Heroes

  - id: devourer
    keyword: DEVOURER
    description: "Monsters with this ability show atypical behavior. They prioritize
      looking for prey rather than victims. Therefore, such Monsters have Injured NPC
      tokens as their Primary Target instead of the Heroes. When they attack one of
      these tokens, they immediately slay them, satiating their bloodthirst. This, however,
      is not a good thing: After doing so, these Monsters complete their purpose and
      their bodies undergo a hideous mutation. Replace the Rotten Flesh model with an
      Abomination model and flip over the Unstable Devourer card. It gains 12 Health
      (this Health can exceed its maximum total) and becomes a Ravenous Abomination.
      If there are no Injured NPCs on the board (if your party has rescued them all,

      When you Empower, the next single Weapon Attack or Spell Attack you make this
      turn gains +4 DMG. Note that this effect lasts only until the end of this turn
      or when you make your next Weapon Attack or Spell Attack (even if you miss), whichever
      comes first. If an effect allows you to make two or more separate Weapon Attack
      as part of the same Action, the Empower effect is only applied to the first of
      them (Cleave is a single hit that affects two or more targets, so this bonus applies
      to all of them).
  - id: end-of-turn-(eot)
    keyword: END OF TURN (EOT)
    description: "EOT is an abbreviation used to describe the “End of Turn” moment of

      can reduce a Character’s Health or remove a Special Character (Pet, Companion,

  - id: heavy-wield
    keyword: HEAVY WIELD
    description: Weapons that have the Heavy Wield property are harder to handle, but
      usually do more damage when they hit. While you are equipped with a Weapon that
      has Heavy Wield, you can make only a single Weapon Attack from each Weapon Attack
      action you take or receive. So, you can't make two Weapon Attack from a single
      Cube Action (as you would with the Twin Strike Skill, for example), Focus Ability,
      Class Ability, or Command you take or receive while using these weapons. But you
      can, for example, make a Weapon Attack through each of your two Cube Actions and
      a third through your Focus Ability or by spending a KI token.
  - id: idol
    keyword: IDOL
    description: Idols are figures that possess magical properties which Heroes are
      able to summon to aid them in battle. When an Idol is Invoked, the Hero places
      or repositions (if that Idol is already on the board) its matching token on the
      center intersection of the area (blue square) they are in or in an area adjacent
      to it. Take note that just Invoking an Idol does not activate its effects immediately
      (Shamans have a class ability that allows them to do this as a special power).
      Once placed, the Idol is considered an Immovable Ground Object, meaning that it
      can’t be moved by any means, including Telekinesis. Each Idol has a power that
      can be Evoked by any Hero (not only the casting one) within Range 1 of that Idol
      using a Minor Action and spending any combination of 2 Resource tokens
  - id: immunity
    keyword: IMMUNITY
    description: This character cannot be affected by the conditions/effect. Stealth
      immunity means they can target that unit and cannot be surprised (x2 DMG).
  - id: inflict
    keyword: INFLICT
    description: This is the term used to designate an effect (usually Conditions) applied
      by a casting Character against a target Character without giving them a chance
      to defend themselves, similar to what non-preventable damage would do. Thus, an
      Inflicted effect does not generate any Attack or Threat (even if it comes from
      an Attack card, for example), not allowing Characters to use their Interrupts
      and Reactions to defend themselves. Remember, if a Character is immune to a Condition,
      naturally, such Condition does not affect it when it is Inflicted on it.
  - id: inspire
    keyword: INSPIRE
    description: Representing a morale boost, when a Hero becomes Inspired, they receive
      an Inspiration token. By discarding one of these tokens (no action required) a
      Hero can reroll any d20 roll they have just made, taking the second result even
      if it is lower than the first. Inspiration is a redundant Resource.
  - id: interact
    keyword: INTERACT
    description: Interactions are situations that happen during an Adventure in which
      your Hero can (or should) intervene. Some Interactions will be presented to your
      party through in-game effects, but most of them will be found on the board as
      Interaction tokens.
  - id: interact-(stack-of-barrels)
    keyword: INTERACT (STACK OF BARRELS)
    description: Dwarves and Halflings (only those) can get inside barrels and use them
      as hiding places. To stop hiding, the Hero will need to use another Minor Action.<br><br>-
      When a Hero enters a barrel, remove their model from the board. While there, they
      won't be able to target, or be targeted, by other Characters with any attack or
      effect. <br>- Monsters know that the Heroes are there. However, they must destroy
      the barrel before attacking them. Thus, when a Monster attacks a character inside
      the barrel, PREVENT all damage that this attack would cause and remove the barrel
      from the board. Reposition the Hero's model (the one that was hidden) in the square
      where the barrel was. <br>- If a Large Monster steps on a barrel with a hidden
      Hero, break that barrel and Shove the Hero aside. That Hero suffers 2 non-preventable
      damage.
  - id: interact-(bookshelf)
    keyword: INTERACT (BOOKSHELF)
    description: When a Hero interacts with a Bookshelf, they can search the Chest deck

    keyword: INTERACT (STONE FOUNTAIN)
    description: "When a Hero interacts with a fountain, they flip the Concoction token
      up, apply its effects, then discard it. There are three possible effects:<br><br>
      **Fresh Water** (Blue): Nothing tastes better to calm rampant emotions! The drinking
      Character Regains 2 Health and gains CLEANSE 2.<br><br> **Empowerment Potion**
      (Orange): Search and you will find! The drinking Character gains INSPIRE and EMPOWER,
      and they may also take an additional Cube Action this turn. If they are a Large
      Monster, they just gain a +4 DMG Boost during this turn instead. <br><br> **Toxic

      Character suffers POISON 4."

    description: Stone Pillars are of no use for anything in particular. They just represent
      a rigid obstacle.
  - id: interrupt
    keyword: INTERRUPT
    description: This Skill can only be used in response to a Character being targeted
      by an Attack, but before the targeted Character spends SHIELD tokens and a threat
      is generated. Thus, Interrupts are “faster” than Reactions. When using an Interrupt,
      a Character will not be able to use a Reaction against any threats generated by
      the attack they have interrupted, as if they had already “reacted” to that attack.
      Interrupts, also, cannot target attacks that deal non-preventable damage, and
      they are not considered Reactions for triggering abilities such as **Caltrops**,
      for example. A Hero can take only one Interruption per attack, regardless of how
      many Characters were targeted by it.
  - id: intimidate-x
    keyword: INTIMIDATE X
    description: Character has -X DMG for each INTIMIDATE token they are holding. Unlike
      other Conditions, INTIMIDATE does not take effect at the beginning of their next
      turn, it lingers until removed instead. The next time the affected character makes
      an Attack (either a Weapon Attack or a Spell Attack), whether it hits or misses,
      it removes all INTIMIDATE tokens they are holding. INTIMIDATE is a stackable Condition.
  - id: jump-x
    keyword: JUMP X
    description: Same as MOVE X but only affected by terrain landed on and can move
      through enemies. Not affected by FALLING DAMAGE. Climbing up 2 levels still costs
      2 movement.
  - id: ki
    keyword: KI
    description: You may discard a KI to make a Weapon Attack with +0 HIT. Regardless
      if you have spent a KI to make a Weapon Attack or to use any other ability you
      have learned, you may only discard one KI per turn or Reaction (If you have an
      ability that is also a Reaction, for example). KI is stackable resource.
  - id: killing-blow
    keyword: KILLING BLOW
    description: Killing Blow is not necessarily a Keyword, but it is a term worth clarifying.
      The Killing Blow is the attack (and in this case it is necessarily an attack,
      Condition damage doesn't count, for example) that is responsible for defeating
      the Monster. If an effect Slays a Character, naturally, it also delivers the Killing
      Blow, since the term Slay specifies that it defeats the Character even though
      it doesn't reduce its Health to 0. **NOTE:** For a Monster to be defeated, it
      must be removed from the board. If an effect reduces a Monster's Health to zero,
      but does not cause it to be removed from the board (as happens if Special Mechanic
      - Shared Lifeline is in progress, for example), the attack is not considered a
      Killing Blow.
  - id: keen
    keyword: KEEN
    description: "In this second generation, we have replaced the Keyword CRIT 16+ with
      “Keen”. The effect remains the same: If you roll a natural 16 or more on the d20,
      you score a Critical Hit. With the introduction of Upgrade Skills and the Warlock
      Trait update, interactions with Wild Cubes will be more common, and doubling the
      numeric value “16+” (supposedly to “CRIT 32+”) is aesthetically displeasing as
      well as representing a detriment to the Skill rather than a benefit. Thus, we
      deemed it appropriate to turn this benefit into a Keyword to avoid this problem."
  - id: knock-down
    keyword: KNOCK DOWN
    description: The Target receives a KNOCK DOWN token. Unlike other Conditions, KNOCK
      DOWN does not take effect at the beginning of the character's next turn, it lingers
      until removed instead. The next time the affected character receives a Move effect,
      it cancels that effect and removes their KNOCK DOWN token from their board. KNOCK
      DOWN is a redundant Condition.
  - id: knock-out
    keyword: KNOCK OUT
    description: Some Skills will risk everything in exchange for victory. When a Hero
      receives a Knock Out effect, they are immediately knocked out as if they had their
      Health reduced to zero (they must lay their model down, take a Trauma Cube, and
      everything else as described in the Rulebook on page 15). An effect with Knock
      Out is final. That is, no effect can prevent you from being Knocked Out in this
      way.
  - id: large-monster

      A Large Monster is immune to KNOCK DOWN, PUSH, STUN, and TELEKINESIS.
  - id: learn
    keyword: LEARN
    description: During the Campaign, the terms used to represent your Hero's progression
      by acquiring a new Skill or Class Ability was “Learns and Unlocks”. From now on,
      this term has been simplified to just “Learn”, but its purpose is the same. So,
      when your Hero learns a Hero or Role Skill Level 1, they must choose a Level 1
      Skill from their Hero or Role, take its respective card and Action Cube, and add
      them to their Hero Board. <br /><br /> **NOTE:** It is important to remember that
      a Hero cannot Learn a Hero or Role Skill of Level 2 if they have not learned a
      Level 1 Skill belonging to that same Skill Tree or Dungeon Role, as already mentioned
      in the Corebox Rulebook. When a Hero learns a Class Ability, they take the matching
      card—if it is the Level 1 Ability for that Class Tree—and a White Cube. They place
      the card beside their board and the cube on the appropriate space to mark the
      Class Ability they have learned. <br /><br /> **NOTE:** Likewise, it is important
      to remember that a Hero cannot Learn a Class Ability of Level 2 or 3 if they have
      not learned a Class Ability of Level 1 or 2 (respectively) belonging to that same
      Class Tree.

      who are adjacent to or on top of them with a Minor Action. When they do, they
      draw the top card of the Chest deck, but do not have to roll the Trap Die: Loot
      is always safe. Like a Chest, the moment a Hero draws a Consumable Item, they

      in their bag."

      another weaker Monster (the Monster with the lowest Health at the time) within
      range 1 of the casting Monster regains X Health (this Health cannot exceed its
      maximum). If two or more Monsters are tied, the one that occupies the highest
      color slot on the Monster Status board between them will be the chosen target

      steps. However, do not worry: once one understands the concept of this effect,
      such steps become intuitive! When a Character suffers Polymorph, you must replace
      their model with a capybara, facing the direction of your choice, and give them
      a Polymorph Condition token. Take note that the direction these Characters face
      is important: When manipulating these Characters again, do not change their facing

      Character simply can’t take actions during their turn. Instead, at the beginning
      of each of their activations, they must roll the d20 to see what happens that

      square back, that is, further away from the source that pushed them. Effectively,
      they will have three squares to which they can be pushed. A Character who has
      suffered Pushback must always choose an unoccupied space where they can be pushed,
      even if it is a harmful terrain or if they have to suffer fall damage because

      a “Command” effect or vice-versa. Likewise, the generic effect of “Activate a
      Pet of your choice” doesn’t work to Raise or Command them. Only the specific effects
      of Raise a Draugr and Command a Draugr affect these creatures. Other than this
      detail, Draugrs follow the same rules as Pets when it comes to their turns and
      other rules purposes. If all four Draugrs are already on the board, a Necromancer
      can no longer Raise them, only Command them (note that unlike other Pets, an effect

      made regarding that element. So, Relearn a Dungeon Role is a simple process of
      “swapping” the cards in your Dungeon Role *(keeping your chosen progressions the
      same as normal)* while Relearn a Skill would be to forget *(remove the progression
      from)* a Skill you have and choose another in its place *(remember, when Relearning

      For example, analyze the following statement about a basic rule regarding Collateral
      damage: <br><br> *“Collateral effects are applied after the damage is resolved.”*
      So, if a character Reacts with a Tumble Skill against a Shadow Knight’s attack,
      they will move before being Knocked Down, since the Tumble Skill (and its Jump
      2) must be fully resolved before any Collateral damage applies (if it is applied
      at all). <br><br> This term can also be found referring to an Interaction or Resolution.
      When this is the case, you should know which of these two elements it is connected
      to. This is the key to understanding its meaning. <br><br> *“Until Interaction...
      is resolved”* means that the Interaction must be done in full; that is, until
      the Interaction token is removed from the board. This might be because it has
      run out of charges or an effect has stipulated that it should be removed before
      that. <br><br> The sentence *“...this Resolution is resolved”* only applies to
      the Resolution you are reading at that moment. Even if a Resolution is abruptly
      resolved by its own command, it will still remove 1 charge from the Interaction
      token (unless it is a Recurring Interaction or the effect itself specifies otherwise,
      of course)."
  - id: restrain
    keyword: RESTRAIN
    description: Characters with the Restrain ability are armed with natural or artificial
      restraints and can use this ability to always keep their opponents within range.
      When a Character is Restrained by an enemy, they receive a Restrain token and
      cannot leave the space they occupy as long as they hold it. A Character may discard
      their Restrain token when there are no more enemies with the ability to Restrain
      them within Range 1. Restrain is a redundant Condition. <br><br>**NOTE:** Characters
      who are Restrained are able to leave their space through a Swap effect. When this
      is the case, the Object swapping with the Restrained Character takes its Restrain
      token. If this target is not a Character, the Restrain effect ends.

    keyword: ROLL X
    description: Triggers a benefit for attack roll on natural roll. +X HIT modifiers
      do not trigger this.
  - id: round
    keyword: ROUND
    description: Round is a term used to denote the window of time from the first card
      to receive a turn on the Initiative Track to the last. Thus, we can say that the
      Hero playing the Defender Dungeon Role will always be the first Character to act
      in a Round while the Rune card will always be the last. All effects that are measured
      through a round (i.e., “...during this round”) end as soon as the Rune card’s
      turn in that round is resolved.
  - id: self
    keyword: SELF
    description: 'Abilities with the SELF Keyword can only target the casting character.
      For example: "SELF, PREVENT 3" means that the character can prevent 3 damage from
      themselves only.'
  - id: shadow-aura
    keyword: SHADOW AURA
    description: A small Darkness tile is placed under Target.
  - id: shield-x
    keyword: SHIELD X
    description: The target gains X SHIELD tokens. Each SHIELD token can be used to
      absorb 1 point of incoming damage against the character. You must use all of your
      SHIELD tokens before losing any Health or using a PREVENT effect—you cannot choose
      to take the damage and keep your SHIELD tokens or to PREVENT the damage with another
      Skill in order to save them. SHIELD tokens are a stackable resource.
  - id: shove
    keyword: SHOVE
    description: When two characters would occupy the same space and one of them has
      priority over the other, we say that the first will shove the second. When a character
      is shoved, it is moved to a square that is adjacent to the area (blue square)
      that it previously occupied. The Party Leader chooses to where a Monster would
      be shoved to, while a shoved Hero can choose their new position for themselves.
      Characters suffer the effects of stepping on harmful terrain when they are shoved
      into them (if they have not suffered them already this turn.)

    description: "Monsters with this ability are terribly dangerous. Attacks made by
      creatures with this ability will pierce any Sturdiness value automatically. So
      be careful: the attack of such creatures is lethal against Allies such as Companions,
      Followers, Pets, and so on (you can still use Prevents from your Reactions or
      Interrupts to try to reduce the damage to 0 and prevent an allied Follower from
      being defeated)."

    keyword: SLAYER
    description: A Monster with this ability will chase Injured NPC tokens, Cohorts,
      and Followers as their Primary Target, in that order of preference. If there are
      two or more of those within reach, the Party Leader chooses which of them will
      be the target of this Monster this turn. If none of these NPCs are on the board
      or in reach, these Monsters switch their Primary Target to the Strongest Hero.
  - id: slow
    keyword: SLOW
    description: The Target receives a SLOW token. Unlike other Conditions, SLOW does
      not take effect at the beginning of that character's next turn, it lingers until
      removed instead. The next time the affected character receives a Move effect,
      it loses 2 movement points from that effect and removes their SLOW token from
      their board. SLOW is a redundant Condition.

  - id: soul-shard
    keyword: SOUL SHARD
    description: By confining a fragment of life energy from a creature's spirit within
      them, these crystals can be used to strengthen the Heroes. As a Minor Action,
      A Hero may discard a Soul Shard to give Double Damage to the next Weapon Attack
      or Spell Attack they make this turn. Note that this effect lasts only until the
      end of this turn or when you make your next Weapon Attack or Spell Attack (even
      if you miss), whichever comes first. If an effect allows you to make two or more
      separate Weapon Attack as part of the same Action, this effect is only applied
      to the first of them *(Cleave is a single hit that affects two or more targets,
      so this bonus applies to all of them)*. Soul Shards are redundant Resource tokens
      that can be exchanged between Heroes as if they were Consumable Items.
  - id: special-mechanic-tokens

      of any Special Mechanic established for an Adventure. Special Mechanic tokens
      are Immovable Ground Objects.
  - id: spent
    keyword: SPENT
    description: Spent is not properly a Keyword, however, it is a term that is worth
      clarifying. An Action Cube is considered spent when it is allocated to a Skill
      slot. Curse Cubes and Trauma Cubes are not considered Action Cubes even when they
      are spent as Action Cubes. They are treated as normal wounds once they become
      allocated to a slot.
  - id: split
    keyword: SPLIT
    description: The casting Character can choose to split the described effect among
      any number of targets (within Range) they choose. To be considered a target, a
      Character must receive a share of at least 1 point. Any empowering bonus that
      character has is applied to the total amount, not to each target they choose.
      <br><br>**Example:** *A Bonus of +1 HEAL applied to a SPLIT, HEAL 4 effect would
      result in a SPLIT, HEAL 5 instead of four individual effects of HEAL 2.*
  - id: spread
    keyword: SPREAD
    description: Some attacks scatter around the victim. Whenever a Hero is hit by SPREAD,
      they reflect the same amount of damage they have suffered (damage suffered is
      the damage that has been taken and has not been mitigated or PREVENTED) on each
      other Hero that is Adjacent to them. This reflected damage is dealt as non-preventable
      damage. For example, Vorn has taken 6 damage with SPREAD. After mitigating 2 damage
      with his 2 SHIELD tokens and PREVENTing 2 damage with a Skill, in the end, he
      suffered 2 damage. Then, each other Hero that is Adjacent to him takes 2 non-preventable
      damage.
  - id: spell-attack
    keyword: SPELL ATTACK
    description: Magic skill that always succeeds, inflicting damage.
  - id: stackable
    keyword: STACKABLE
    description: The Stackable property means that a character can hold up to 4 copies
      of a same token on their boards/cards. A two-sided token that displays the faces
      1 and 2 must always be considered as if it was the number of individual tokens
      indicated. If a character would receive a fifth token of a Stackable effect, just
      ignore it. <br><br>**Example:** *2 tokens of Focus 2 and 4 tokens of Focus 1 are
      considered Focus 4 either way.*
  - id: stalker-(trait)
    keyword: STALKER (TRAIT)
    description: Some killers specialize in using stealth to their advantage. As long
      as the Stalker Skill is not blocked, whenever the Slayer's Stealth fades away
      *(that is, it is removed on its own at the beginning of its Hero's turn)*, the
      Slayer remains Hidden until the end of the current Hero's turn or until they try
      to surprise another Character. <br><br>**Example:** *Nyx received Stealth through
      the **Sucker Punch** Skill in the previous round. At the beginning of her turn,
      in this new round, her Stealth faded away, but she will still remain hidden until
      she tries to surprise another Character (which could lead her to cause Double
      Damage) or finishes her current turn (so, she would need to cast another Stealth
      effect if she wanted to continue in Stealth to escape the Monsters attacks).*
  - id: status
    keyword: STATUS
    description: Status is a reward related to a choice a character made during the
      story. Some Statuses can give special abilities as if they were some kind of blessing,
      while others are just related to the story. Regardless, a character can have any
      number of Statuses noted on their Campaign Log and all Statuses are erased during
      the next Camp Phase.
  - id: stealth
    keyword: STEALTH
    description: The Target receives a STEALTH Token and is considered hidden while
      they are holding it. <br><br>- Characters without Immunity to STEALTH do not count
      a hidden character either as their Target nor an enemy for engagement purposes
      (they still can't pass through them if they are enemies). - Hidden characters
      still take damage from area Attacks such as STRIKE and from Darkness. <br>- At
      the beginning of its next turn, the character is no longer hidden and must discard
      its STEALTH token.<br><br>Alternatively, as many seasoned assassins do, a character
      can end their STEALTH sooner by trying to Surprise a Target. <br><br>- Thus, if
      a character with a STEALTH token makes a Weapon Attack, whether it hits or not,
      it Immediately loses STEALTH. On the other hand, if the Attack hits, it gains
      DOUBLE DAMAGE if the attacking character was considered hidden from its Target.
      This is called "Surprise." <br>- Characters immune to STEALTH cannot be Surprised.

    description: The Hero with the most Health at the moment. Monsters often target
      the Strongest Hero. If two Heroes are tied with the most Health, the Strongest
      one among then will be the one who occupies the fastest Initiative Slot.
  - id: stun
    keyword: STUN
    description: STUN works differently between Heroes and Monsters. When the STUN effect
      is resolved at the beginning of a Monster's turn, that Monster loses its Attack
      action for that turn and then removes the STUN token *(it will still take its
      Move action)*. At the beginning of an affected Hero's turn, on the other hand,
      they lose one of their two allowed Cube Actions for that turn and then remove
      the token from their board. STUN is a redundant Condition.
  - id: sturdiness
    keyword: STURDINESS
    description: Damage exceeding this number defeats the companion.
  - id: suffer
    keyword: SUFFER
    description: Suffer is not properly a Keyword, however, it is a term that is worth
      clarifying. Suffer is used to define something that “hits” a Character after they
      have tried to protect themselves against it. So, “suffer damage” means to lose
      Health due to damage after you tried (if you could, naturally) to mitigate it
      through Prevent, Shield tokens, and so on.
  - id: swap
    keyword: SWAP
    description: Two objects trade positions amd CHARACTERS are affected by harmful
      terrain or Darkness landed on.
  - id: swarm
    keyword: SWARM
    description: Swarm Monsters are tiny creatures that, joined together, form a single
      being, and thus they have no vital points in their body. Such creatures suffer
      only half damage (rounded up, after Prevent reductions have been applied) of all
      Weapon Attack that hit them.<br><br> **Example:** *If Lorelai has 2 Intimidate
      tokens when she attacks a Monster that has Swarm and 1 Shield token using a 6-damage
      attack, that Monster would suffer only 2 points of damage in the end (6 - 2 -
      1 = 3; 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5, which is then rounded up to 2).*
  - id: take
    keyword: TAKE
    description: Take is not properly a Keyword, however, it is a term that is worth
      clarifying. Take is used to describe something that is given to a Character. Whenever
      that is damage, they have the opportunity to mitigate it through Shield tokens
      or Prevent effects (unless, of course, the damage is non-preventable). If it is
      a Condition (such as Bleed) or an Effect (such as Telekinesis), that Character
      can’t use Reactions or Interrupts to avoid it, but if they are Immune to the said
      effects, they simply won't take them. Taking a Curse Cube, on the other hand,
      is different from suffering Curse and thus, this effect can't be avoided even
      if the Character is Immune to Curse.
  - id: telekinesis-x
    keyword: TELEKINESIS X
    description: Move any small-sized object (including small Darkness tiles) or SOLID
      OBJECTS (except Interactions) up to X SQUARES. Target is affected by harmful terrain
      or Darkness landed on including FALLING DAMAGE.
  - id: threat
    keyword: THREAT
    description: Threat is the term used to define the moment when a Hero can have their
      Health points reduced by some attack or effect, but is able to defend themselves
      and try to prevent this from happening.<br><br>Thus, Threat essentially defines
      when a Hero can usea Reaction in-game. As a rule, Heroes can use such Skills or
      Abilities whenever a Hero (either themselves or an ally) is threatened, that is,
      when they take preventable damage (non-preventable damage never generates a Threat).<br><br>Take
      note that Threat is just a term, it doesn't change any rules. Therefore, Reactions
      with “SELF” can only be used if the casting Character is also being threatened
      and so on, as described on page 14 of the Corebox Rulebook.

    description: When thrown at a Character, a barrel deals 2 DMG and inflicts KNOCK
      DOWN to its target if it is a Small Character. Large Monsters bodies are so powerful
      that barrels don't even bother them. <br><br> - However, if a Hero was hidden
      inside the barrel, the throwing causes +2 DMG and it can even target Large Monsters
      and inflict KNOCK DOWN to them (overcoming their immunity thanks to the extra
      weight). <br>- Reposition the Hero that was in the barrel in a square of their
      choice that is adjacent to the target against which the barrel was thrown. *(Don't

      Action. Instead, it is simply knocked over, affecting a Character that is adjacent
      to it (chosen by the Hero who used the Throw Furniture Minor Action). TELEKINESIS,
      on the other hand, can throw a bookshelf normally. <br><br>- Regardless of the
      way it was thrown, a bookshelf deals 2 DMG and inflicts STUN to its target (Don’t
      forget: Thrown Furniture is always broken and removed from the board.)"

  - id: throw-(stone-pillar)
    keyword: THROW (STONE PILLAR)
    description: Stone Pillars are attached to the floor and ceiling and therefore cannot
      be thrown at other characters in any way. However, it is precisely because they
      are so firm that the opposite becomes true:<br><br>- When a Character is thrown
      against a stone pillar (by effects like TELEKINESIS or PUSH), they suffer 4 non-preventable
      damage and are repositioned in a square adjacent to the pillar chosen by the Character
      who threw them. The pillar is not removed from the board.

  - id: turn
    keyword: TURN
    description: Turn is the term used to designate the time window in which a Character
      or a card on the Initiative Track may act. Even though a Monster type has only
      one card in the Initiative Track to represent all units of that type, each Monster’s
      turn is taken individually. Therefore, the turn of a Shadow Knight with a pink
      snap-on base is different from the turn of a Shadow Knight with the green snap-on
      base. This distinction is important, because effects that can be used once per
      turn can be used once during the turn of each of these Shadow Knights, for example.
  - id: unavailable
    keyword: UNAVAILABLE
    description: This is a game term usually associated with Interactions. When an effect
      states that a Resolution becomes unavailable, it means that Heroes cannot choose
      that Resolution anymore. Whenever a Hero chooses a Resolution from a Charged Interaction,
      for example, it becomes unavailable and cannot be chosen again during this Adventure.

      point, the Necromancer may choose to take a Curse Cube to extend the Unlife of
      such a Pet for one turn—This is called “Taint”. They may choose for each Pet with

      card over if there are no Action Cubes occupying any of its slots. You can even
      flip a card that is in your bag. <br><br>**NOTE:** If you flip a Versatile Equipment

      Conditions by inflicting them back against the Heroes. Thus, at the beginning
      of these Monsters turn, when they are to be affected by Stackable Conditions *(Burn,
      Bleed, and Intimidate are examples of Stackable Conditions)*, if any of its enemies
      (Hero, Pet, Companion etc.) are within Range 1 of that Monster, instead of it
      undergoing such effects, move them to the strongest enemy among them. If the Monster

    description: Characters who have the Warden trait can use Interrupts and Reactions
      with the Keyword “SELF” on other Characters as long as they are adjacent to them.
      Also, Wardens can use such Skills when Characters adjacent to them are attacked
      or threatened (if the Skill you are using is either an Interrupt or a Reaction,
      respectively) instead of using them only when they are attacked or threatened
      themselves.

      for power. As long as the Otherwordly Pact Skill is not blocked, they receive

      And, you'll be able to do it with preeminence from now on! An effect that Wild
