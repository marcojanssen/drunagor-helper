Their behavior remains the same: they move as few squares as possible to the target unless they can finish the movement upon Darkness or can avoid harmful terrain while doing so.

So, when your Hero learns a Hero or Role Skill Level 1, they must choose a Level 1 Skill from their Hero or Role, take its respective card and Action Cube, and add them to their Hero Board. <br /><br /> **NOTE:** It is important to remember that a Hero cannot Learn a Hero or Role Skill of Level 2 if they have not learned a Level 1 Skill belonging to that same Skill Tree or Dungeon Role, as already mentioned in the Corebox Rulebook. When a Hero learns a Class Ability, they take the matching card—if it is the Level 1 Ability for that Class Tree—and a White Cube. They place the card beside their board and the cube on the appropriate space to mark the Class Ability they have learned. <br /><br /> **NOTE:** Likewise, it is important to remember that a Hero cannot Learn a Class Ability of Level 2 or 3 if they have not learned a Class Ability of Level 1 or 2 (respectively) belonging to that same Class Tree."

When this is the case, you should know which of these two elements it is connected to. This is the key to understanding its meaning. <br><br> *“Until Interaction... is resolved”* means that the Interaction must be done in full; that is, until the Interaction token is removed from the board. This might be because it has run out of charges or an effect has stipulated that it should be removed before that. <br><br> The sentence *“...this Resolution is resolved”* only applies to the Resolution you are reading at that moment.
